### **Employee Sentiment Analysis Final Report**

---

#### **Task 1: Sentiment Labeling**

- Used Hugging Face’s `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model
- Added a `Sentiment` column with values: Positive, Negative, or Neutral
- Fallback logic used `subject` when `body` was missing
- Dataset saved to `labeled_messages.csv`

---

#### **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Explored missing data patterns, sentiment distributions, and message trends
- Key findings:
  - 145 emails with no subject
  - Top 5 most active employees identified
-all messages labeled positive, negative, neutral
-combined subject with body for sentiment analysis
The dataset contains 2,191 rows and 7 columns.
All columns are of type object, except for date_parsed, which is a datetime64. 
The sentiments distribute heavily, almost equally, towards positive and neutral, and very lightly towards negative.
Monthly sentiment trends can now be explored in visualizations (e.g., bar plots) to detect engagement fluctuations over time. A few employees stood out as high-volume senders. These employees may warrant further review in scoring and flight risk analysis.
- Visuals saved in `/visualization/`

#### **Task 3: Monthly Sentiment Scores**

- Mapped sentiments to scores: +1 (Positive), 0 (Neutral), -1 (Negative)
- Grouped by sender and month
- Exported to `monthly_sentiment_scores.csv`

---

#### **Task 4: Ranking Employees**

- Ranked top 3 and bottom 3 employees by sentiment score each month
- Based on score descending (positive) and ascending (negative)
- Results stored in `monthly_employee_rankings.csv`

---

#### **Task 5: Flight Risk Detection**

- Defined at-risk employees as those with ≥4 negative messages in any 30-day window
- Filtered and flagged employees using rolling checks
- Flag list saved to `flight_risk_employees.csv`

---

#### **Task 6: Sentiment Score Prediction**

- Features used:
  - Message count per month
  - Avg message length
  - Avg word count
- Model: Linear Regression (`sklearn`)
- Results:
  - R² Score: 0.42765020804350784
  - RMSE: 1.994649338696962
- Coefficients showed which features most influenced predicted sentiment
          Feature  Coefficient
0       msg_count     0.347254
1  avg_msg_length    -0.004865
2  avg_word_count     0.039418

*Conclusion:
Message count had the strongest positive influence on sentiment, suggesting more frequent communication tends to be more positive.
Average message length and average word count have a weak linear relationship with sentiment
